<center><b>I Want Out</b> is a react web app that lets users figure out a new home from around the world!</center>
     
Users can quickly search for cities by name and visualize major details. 
The app uses the teleport API to find statistics for certain cities.
Users can learn about the following: <br>
* Quality of Life
* Housing
* Career opportunities
* Education
* Weather
After seraching for the cities, graphs will be automatically updated to be viewed by the user.

<br>

The app uses redux for state management, react for the front-end and a combination of node, express and mongo for the backend.
