<center><b>PINE</b> is a mobile app that allows you to create, personalize and manage your tasks.</center>
     
The app is based on the Ivy-Lee method, a productivity method where the user must create and prioritize six tasks every night.
The highest priority task must be completed before the next one is started. The simplistic UI in the app allows users to quickly create apps and sort them. Sub tasks may be added to each task, and may be personalized with different colors and icons. At the beginning of each day the tasks are presented to the user in a card UI that focuses on the highest priority task.
