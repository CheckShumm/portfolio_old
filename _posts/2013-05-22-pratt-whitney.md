## Data Science Intern
### Pratt and Whitney Canada
#### Fall 2016

### Description

For my internship at Pratt and Whitney Canada, I worked as a sole developer in a business team.
The team was in charge of business operations and was tasked to ensure the work pipeline is as efficient as possible.
My main role consisted of building and maintaining applications that automate certain tasks.

### Contributions
* Automated the creation of forecasting charts, used in weekly meetings, to clearly depict inefficiencies in the workforce.
* Created an application to predict when engine repairs would be completed and shipped based on previous data.
* Created an application to compare the company workforce to predicted upcoming workload for several global plants. The application was used to justify hiring requests at a company offsite.
* Created a slotting app, where users could keep track of engines up for repair.
