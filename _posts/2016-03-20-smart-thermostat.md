<center><b>Choices</b> is a thermostat that recommends temperatures for a room based on outdoor conditions!</center>
     
 A basic smart home thermometer built using ESP8266(IOT microcontroller), DHT22 (temperature and humidity) sensors and an OLED screen.
Uses wunderground's API to retrieve nearby weather conditions and compare them to internal temperature and humidity captured from the microcontroller.
Displays relevant information on the screen. Compatible with Honeywell smart thermostats.
