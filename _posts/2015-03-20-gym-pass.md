<center><b>Gym Pass</b> is an all in one gym membership app that includes a scanner for staff to validate memberships!</center>
     
Instead of using traditional passes such as paper or plastic cards, all gym membership necessities are bundled into one application. 
The app has two variants, one for users and one for gym staff members. The user app allows registration for the gym, tracking of gym crowdedness and push notifications.
The app was prototyped using 3D printed doors using electromagnetic locks. Gym passes are represented as QR codes, upon validation the door is automatically unlocked.

This app and IOT door was created for a school project.
